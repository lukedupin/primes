Interesting findings.

Everything repeats at an interval of either

Length = 
6^2 * x^2 -1 or
(6*x - 1) * (6*x + 1)

+-1 will always overlap on the 6x-1 line at: 6*x^2
+-1 will always overlap on the 6x+1 line at: Length - 6*x^2

From the +-1 overlap, the center of expanding +- interactions is always 6*x interval

The expansion of overlap increases by 1 step in both positive and negative directions: +.- then +...- then +.....-
There is a point where The +.X.- will be touching another plus. The feature is always +.x.-+....+- and then reverses.

The gap between -+ and then next +- is always 6*(x-1)+4 or 6x-2

The 6x+1 and -1 always have an interaction of .+ and .- as the start and the opposite at the end - and +. The gap between these is x.
